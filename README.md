### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I believe that the topics in our labs did prepare us for certain aspects of this assignment. However there were some features in this project I did feel unprepared to complete. Due to me having my mentor meeting on Wednesday, I was not able to finish lab 3 and left me a bit stuck on using API data and implementing it as I don't have a lot of experience with working with APIs. I also was a bit lost on the innerHTML parts of this project as well, as since I am not very experienced in web development it has been taking me a bit longer to grasp certain concepts.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I definitely would have wanted to add features such as: clearing the search field after someone hits submit, creating a back to the top feature, and I would want to create a navigation bar at the top where users can switch to a different tab and search for other things such as TV Shows and Video games as those are also on the TMDB API as well.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

During my project demo, I think I did well at presenting my project, however due to time issues, I sped through the reflection questions that I was supposed to answer during my demo. Something that my peer did that I think I might do the next time I have a demo is go into my detail of stating my problem and going into more detail about how I fixed it as other people may be having the issues that I had.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

I would like to shoutout Rebecca(TA), she really helped me grasp the concepts of the API I didn't at first grasp and I wouldn't have been able to do this project without her help.
